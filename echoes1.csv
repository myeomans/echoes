I was very sleepy when I woke up due to insomnia. The baby woke up, and therefore woke me up, as I heard him on the monitor. I grabbed him and brought him into bed to nurse him. Then I came downstairs, played ""chase"" on the floor with him for a few minutes, made some hot tea. (I hope these count as activities?) /  / In the afternoon, I switched between mTurk and the baby. I worked quite a bit, completing various tasks on mTurk, mostly surveys. The baby took a long nap on my chest (he usually naps in my room, but he's sick, so it's easier for him to sleep in an upright position right now so that he can breathe), and I very slowly and awkwardly worked on mTurk while he was napping with me. I picked my 9 year old son up from school around 3:00 and brought him home, and we had a brief conversation about his day, which he's always very reticent to have for reasons that elude my understanding. /  / In the evening, a friend of mine came over and spent a few hours with the kids. She fixed dinner for them so that I could continue to work. I continued working on mTurk, and surpassed my earning goal for the day, so that was great. When I was done with work, I took a bath with the baby, dressed him, used the suction bulb to get some of the snot out of his nose (which he decidedly did NOT enjoy), and rocked him to sleep while watching a little TV on my laptop. After that, I made cheese fries topped with pulled pork for dinner for myself and relaxed on the couch for a few hours before bed, reading some news articles and watching a little more TV.
