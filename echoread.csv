"R_3s7Hxo4igUYkA8U","football","advocate","car","They have an MVP candidate quarterback and they have an amazing defense. The Broncos have an awful offense and an okay defense. Cam will pounce on them. ",
"R_2c87Rw0xeo0w26y","football","advocate","car","Cam Newton is almost unstoppable as both a passer and a rusher.  Peyton Manning's performance has been slipping.  Carolina has a great defense that can stop the run.  The Panthers really want to win their first Superbowl.",
"R_33ps9Go2PEylkJf","football","advocate","car","I really don't know much about either team.  I think historically the Panthers have had more winning games than the Broncos.  But I could be wrong about that.",
"R_1pyZ36oWOemenlx","football","advocate","car","The panthers will win because they are simply the better team. Cam Newton is more younger, faster and stronger than Peyton Manning these days.",
"R_2idGNACYunaAnAt","football","advocate","car","I think that the Panthers have a better defense line and will be able to hold off any offense from the Broncos. Further more Manning seems to be loosing seem in his arm this whole season. I dont think he will be able to hang",
"R_2xWyzqQk7maeEvi","football","advocate","car","They have been playing much better this season especially against the class that denver is in. Statistically I believe they are out-performing denver and they have it in the bag. I don't believe it will even be that close of a game.",
"R_WkuZLOhFrZXuXx7","football","advocate","car","The Carolina Panthers are the better team. I don't think the Broncos defense can stop all of the weapons the Panthers have on offense. The Panthers defense will be able to keep the Broncos offense in check also.",
"R_1djmBu8rCerAxsm","football","advocate","car","In my estimation both teams are equally skilled. The fact that they both made it to the super bowl is a testament to this fact. It is my belief that both teams have an equally likely chance of winning, although I would put my money on the Carolina Panthers as they seem to have a better overall team when looking at the previous seasons game play and statistics.",
"R_22yQIPUYO3oYNYL","football","advocate","car","Someone who watched this NFL season will note that the Panthers dominated almost every team they played this season, often winning by double digits. Carolina locked up the first seed in the NFC early due to their domination. During the playoffs, Carolina proved themselves virtually unstoppable, completely outplaying and shutting down their opponents. In addition, the Broncos have a weak running game and Peyton Manning is in the twilight of his career.",
"R_2DY2vSTcBnnjLIY","football","advocate","car","In actuality, I know very little about sports. However, I have the belief that the Carolina Panthers will win because I'm from South Carolina and feel an attachment to the team. I know that sort of abandons logic, but it's where my opinion mainly stems from.",
"R_1GK4DEQwYZOV5XZ","football","advocate","car","The Carolina Panthers are currently at 15 to 1, having lost just ONE game in the season. The Broncos, however, are at 12 to 4, having lost four. /  / While it isn't a definite, I feel the Panthers have shown they're on a role this season and it'll continue with them stomping the Broncos. ",
"R_3hyaExbN06c9WXz","football","advocate","car","The Panthers are a much more physically aggressive team than the Broncos, and they have a much more powerful offensive line. The broncos are also an ""older"" team, and Manning isn't in his prime any more. They were crushed by the Seahawks in 2013, and the Panthers could be seen as even more aggressive than them. The Broncos rely on trick plays and finesse, which doesn't help them at all against a team like Carolina. ",
"R_2VkDwoPyW0u5PTm","football","advocate","car","The Carolina Panthers are a superlative team, competent, skilled, and totally prepared to take on the Broncos. They have some of the best football players in the nation. They have consistently and effortlessly crushed their opponents in every game leading up to the SuperBowl. Given the Broncos' weak history and their struggle to even make it to the SuperBowl, there is no question that the Panthers will demolish them.",
"R_2UgufC9q1HpLOke","football","advocate","car","The Carolina Panthers has shown consistently stronger performance in both the offense and defense fronts, resulting in higher ratio of wins to losses compared to the Denver Broncos. While the Broncos has a great quarterback, the Panthers work better together as a team.",
"R_3eihtghFoBImWax","football","advocate","car","I do not believe that they are more likely to win, I believe that they have an equal chance to win. The probability being 50/50 to win or lose.",
"R_3Ge7Cj9gt2X9i2n","football","advocate","car","They are stronger players and have more confidence to win this. They also have stronger fan base that creates morale and helps them to win.",
"R_1ooQiGqNoIhOEw8","football","advocate","car","The have a better quarterback and have been a better team all year. Also, the odds makers favor them.",
"R_siLRYAUaUKeaVzz","football","advocate","car","I really don't know much about either team, as i do not follow (or care about) football.  But there is a chimpanzee at the local zoo that has predicted 10 out of the last 12 Super bowl winners.  That chimp has chosen the Carolina Panthers this year.  So i am relying on that chimp.",
"R_1LUuohrik6RWajZ","football","advocate","car","The panthers are the better team this year. they have only lost one game so far. Cam Newton is younger and a better QB than Peyton Manning.",
"R_3iK1mVYvSZGquee","football","advocate","car","I don't know. I only know who is playing because my siblings follow American football. I don't know enough about football or the teams to make a judgement. So yes, I did randomly pick a team that might win the Super Bowl.",
"R_3hbdyNYqTXsXO9l","football","advocate","car","They've been performing strongly all season, had a nearly undefeated season and really seem to have a lot of momentum. ",
"R_24hYyzZc4KWUE6n","football","advocate","car","The Carolina Panthers have had a record winning season.  Cam Newton is young and fast on his feet with endless receivers to make a catch.  The Broncos are good but Peyton Manning  has not been on his game.  I see him throwing a few picks that will lose them the game.",
"R_29hN01fxsB2NzPv","football","advocate","car","I honestly have no idea. I am just going with my first instinct. I do not have any statistical information to back up my opinion. ",
"R_3Rsar6DT97LMLSP","football","advocate","car","Panthers have only lost one game and Cam Newton is younger and quicker QB. The offense and defense I feel has an edge over the Broncos team. ",
"R_3PTrgpFarRlxLeT","football","advocate","car","I don't know much about football and I don't like it, but I'll give it a shot anyway. The Carolina Panthers wear blue and black which looks alright. The Denver Broncos just remind of a shitty car, so I'll put my faith in the former.",
"R_2s5z1W0oqa18KZg","football","advocate","car","Carolinas offense is top notch this year.  This gives them a huge advantage in my opinion.  In comparison the Broncos have a somewhat limited offense.  Also Manning has started to lose it while Carolina's Cam Newton is at the top of his game.  Theyre also just a better team all around.",
"R_0PVjyHhOaaTalaN","football","advocate","car","Cam Newton is a great QB, and I think he has the ability to make good plays for the team. The team has done really well this year and I think they have a good chance!",
"R_2c1npJMyC6xSlhk","football","advocate","car","Well, I did indicate there was a 50% chance of them winning. I think both teams are capable enough, as they are both in the final game. From what I know, the PAnthers have a good Quarterback, and have the upper hand. So, that's why I selected them. But deep down, I feel it's 50/50.",
"R_30tKXuP6r8mlGVI","football","advocate","car","I think Cam Newton is a great quarterback and gives them a tremendous edge. Carolina has beat some great teams and performed extremely well in their last playoff game. The Broncos are good and have veteran Peyton Manning but their defense will not be good enough to beat the Panthers.",
"R_3iKGrxQm2ctqIEB","football","advocate","car","I think Carolina will win the Super Bowl for two main reasons. First, Peyton Manning is not in good health and will struggle to move the ball against Carolina's great defense. Second, Cam Newton has looked amazing this year and I believe he will carry his team on his shoulders to victory.",
"R_1mq1JrxMjNDRRfP","football","advocate","car","I think that Carolina is the more complete team.  While Denver has the #1 defense in football, Carolina has the #1 offense and their defense is ranked 5th or 6th.  Denver will most likely struggle on offense and as long as Carolina doesn't turn the ball over too much they should win fairly handily. ",
"R_eJqhH01ZWIgGaZP","football","advocate","car","The Panthers are on paper a stronger team than the Broncos this year. They've put up better stats overall and performed more strongly against other teams, when compared to the Broncos.",
"R_1IsfQH0q6KjW92V","football","advocate","car","The Panthers have a better team. Peyton Manning isn't as good as he used to be.",
"R_3PbIlzikAwXKPo4","football","advocate","car","I am a Panthers fan and have been following them all year.  This is not only the best team in football, they are playing their best ball right now in the postseason.  They have a top-3 defense, which I honestly believe is better than the Broncos despite what the stats say, since the NFC was the stronger conference this year.  They also have the top scoring offense in the NFL.  They have played consecutive games against other top-5 defenses, and have completely lit them up on the scoreboard.  While Denver does indeed have a great D, they are quite weak on the offensive side of the ball.  Peyton Manning is old, injured, and frankly a liability.  Osweiler is not ready for prime time.  Denver is going to struggle mightily to put up points in this game.  Remember Denver getting embarrassed in the Super Bowl 2 years ago?  This is going to be more of the same.",
"R_3OpS1vpqTJekZxH","football","advocate","car","Carolina has had an impressive year. Only loosing one regular season game if I remember correctly. Denver has had a more difficult run and are weak in the quarterback position.",
"R_3Jt2OmL14f0p7RL","football","advocate","car","The Carolina Panthers have a better running game. Their quarterback is completely fearless. He is a physical as they come. He can do everything on that field and that is what makes him so scary. Peyton doesn't know how to handle Cam and will have no plan for him. The Carolina defense will sack Peyton time and time again because he is slow and old.",
"R_3lWgbtfMhkugkhw","football","advocate","car","Cam Newton is playing on an entirely different level than any of his competitors right now. I just can't see the Bronco's defense stopping him. He is just too dangerous in the open field and can destroy defenses with his legs if they don't have a spy on him. While Peyton Manning is still phenomenal, he's on his last stretch and I doubt he has as much left in the tank as a young and hungry Cam Newton does. Carolina's defense is also phenomenal as well so Peyton will have his work cut out for him. It just seems that every phase of the game will lean in Carolina's favor. ",
"R_2sc34XQ9Kwdsxnk","football","advocate","car","I have almost no basis whatsoever for believing Carolina will beat Denver. My only knowledge of the teams is second-hand. I know some Carolina fans who are very enthusiastic and believe the team is strong. They haven't been wrong yet.",
"R_6sqwaMaTMxr1EI1","football","advocate","car","The Carolina Panthers will beat the Denver Broncos because they are just a better team all around.  They have a much better defense and an offense that is on a roll.  In addition, they are riding a momentum that will be hard to overcome. They are a younger team and will have more energy.",
"R_33DTU9Had4mTgWA","football","advocate","car","The Panthers seem like a fired up team, while the Broncos seem to be like the Old Guard.  Cam Newton seems like he is on fire and inspires the rest of his team.",
"R_2ARpaejwlPx8gP1","football","advocate","car","The Carolina panthers might beat the Denver Broncos because they are a better all around team.  In addition, Their quarterback is younger and more dynamic than Denver's, who is old and probably in or near his final season.",
"R_2qpG9d5g8gnjqKW","football","advocate","car","Carolina is simply the better team.  They are well-rounded of offense, with both a solid passing game and  a sound running game.  Their defense is very good, and will give Denver's offense all that it can handle.  Also, Carolina has a ton of momentum, as they have only lost one game all season.  Denver is lucky to even be in the Super Bowl, as they got very lucky last week against New England.",
"R_2dTpe9ShH13XVBa","football","advocate","car","Just the better team right now. They're coming in hot and looking great during the playoffs. I don't see any team beating them right now. Denver may have a great defense, but their offense has sputtered at times. I think Carolina wings big on Sunday.",
"R_w5g2dMixkgq0W5j","football","advocate","car","I think they have a better offense. They also have the better defense I think they will stop the Broncos from scoring many touchdowns.",
"R_1QrPS4ciOlcnYTx","football","advocate","car","Overall the panthers are a better team. They have a better running and passing game. They are on a hot streak now. The broncos wont be able to catch up / ",
"R_1lh3F2UJnbZ2lnE","football","advocate","car","Carolina is more likely to win the Super Bowl because of Cam Newton.  He is the biggest, strongest, fastest quarterback ever, and their record of 17-1 proves how dominant they have been.  Even though Denver has the league's best defense statistically, they have not yet faced an offense with a quarterback who can not only throw with such strength and precision while so ably avoiding getting sacked, but also break through the line with incredible strength and speed for long rushes.  He's going to be very difficult to stop. Carolina's defense also has amazing playmakers, and I'm pretty sure they have the most interceptions in the league.",
"R_3iIFyAURzLqXVfx","football","advocate","car","Carolina has an overall tougher team.  Even though the Broncos are highly favored, the Panthers have had a more solid performance over the past year.  Their determination will also be a major force in their success.",
"R_1ezUxBerj5wS2iN","football","advocate","car","As much as I want Peyton Manning to end his career on a high note, I am rooting for the panthers for the simple fact that I just like the team more then the Broncos. /   I am a Patriots fan and pretty much just watch their games,  but Since I have to choose, I choose the Panthers because I think they have great defense, a strong team, and have made it this far with a strong offence.",
"R_2qyla94tHeGUYnD","football","advocate","car","Denver has a good defense, but the Panthers have a more rounded team, they have a complete offense and a defense that is just as good if not better than Denver. Besides that I can't stand the donkeys.",
"R_2Vlk6Hzo3Mfp7zf","football","advocate","car","They're a faster and more dynamic team - while Denver has the experience, the Panthers have the passion and youth on their side. Cam Newton has had a better performance than Manning this season.",
"R_2UcqKtxAITIT1st","football","advocate","car","Carolina Panthers have better offense than the Denver Broncos.",
"R_3M4eXu3EdOQJYJ0","football","advocate","car","I believe that they are favored to win by most betting agencies, so if that's what the books are predicting, it seems like a more likely outcome.",
"R_3GvxFcJGsq62PDC","football","advocate","car","The Carolina Panthers are more likely to win the superbowl because they have a better more well-rounded team than the Denver Broncos. They have a history of making bold, unexpected plays this season that throws their other team off-guard. They have had no injuries this season and all of their players are strong and ready to go.",
"R_qCP3ed1xSPxH6k9","football","advocate","car","I think that the Panthers have a good defense.  Denver's is slightly better, but Carolina also has an excellent defense.  Denver's offense had a pretty bad year, and Carolina's offense was very good this year.  Carolina has the best overall chance in the game due to a vastly superior offense.",
"R_3dQkbKKHYlJRcmi","football","advocate","den","Denver has the experience and the drive to win this game. The Broncos are used to the pressure of the Super Bowl and will come into it knowing exactly what to expect. This will make them less nervous, make less mistakes on the field, and ultimately will lead to victory over the Panthers.",
"R_29oU7nivwinFkh2","football","advocate","den","In all honesty. I don't even watch Football. I can't tell you whats good about the team and what's bad about them. All I can tell you is that their team name sounds fierce. It sounds like a name good enough to strike fear into an opponent. So I went with my gut and choose them.",
"R_29jn3ag6hJlGrfh","football","advocate","den","I think that Denver Broncos are doing really well this year, and they beat my favorite team in the playoffs. ",
"R_2QmI2sanOeFK77l","football","advocate","den","I believe that the Denver Broncos will beat the Carolina Panthers by a slim margin. This game is possibly the last football game of Peyton Manning's career, and his teammates are probably hyped up to help with a historic win for their quarterback. There is also the level of expertise to consider, since Cam Newton is a relatively new quarterback in the NFL. ",
"R_NWkuAbFQ1j8ivx7","football","advocate","den","I think the game will be close, but in the end the Broncos will win. The Broncos are the best team in the league right now. They just have the most talented players.",

"R_3M5rzfTBggoxmkr","football","advocate","den","The Denver Broncos are steadily a solid team.  Both their offensive and their defense are outstanding and very consistent.  While Carolina has to be a good team to make it to this point they do not have the consistency I see from the Broncos.",
"R_1dykwQeorsikWWb","football","advocate","den","I feel as though they have a better track record, with seasoned players that will hold steady and win.  I'm not a fan of either team, and frankly hate the Broncos, but I do think they are a better team than Carolina. / ",
"R_3sbpXIIZtek0z77","football","advocate","den","The Denver Broncos are a more well rounded team and from watching their previous games I feel that they have the best shot of winning.",
"R_3jcjTV7kdvEohtQ","football","advocate","den","I think the Denver Broncos might win because I think the Broncos have a better team overall. They have a better defense. They also have a better quaterback. The Broncos have more experience than the Panthers. Therefore, I think they have a higher chance of winning.",
"R_3dPKkUlMW8znecz","football","advocate","den","The Denver Broncos have won the Super Bowl before. While the team is not composed of exactly the same people as at that time, there are still legacy members of the staff present. Also, habits brought down from that experience should increase the probability that the Denver Broncos will triumph.",
"R_O2QgYoSEHT2rx2F","football","advocate","den","I don't know a lot about either team, but I have heard more about the Broncos. Because I have heard more about the team, I expect them to do better.",
"R_3h40g3XqHgMHR2f","football","advocate","den","The Denver Broncos will win the Super Bowl because it tells a better story. I would look to what is going on in their city or region. They have had trouble with legal issues. they probably have had some mass shootings. They are closer to California, where the last terrorist plot unfolded. I think the Broncos will win because of other factors outside football. ",
"R_32Jak2Wmf0If2wo","football","advocate","den","It seems as though the majority of individuals who actually take the time to pay attention to professional football are in relative unison that the Denver Broncos are going to win. Ergo, if I was hard-pressed to put my own money on a team, I would definitely choose the Broncos. ",
"R_xGvdOP9A5DWsBrj","football","advocate","den","I think that this game will be a close one.  The Panthers have played really well and are a tough team to beat. But, I really feel like the Broncos are going to pull it out.  They have experience and, arguably, one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL.  Plus, Peyton Manning is thinkging about retirement. I'm sure he really wants to end his career with a Super Bowl win.  He's proven before that he can rally his team and pull out big wins in the fourth quarter. I think that will happen this Sunday.",
"R_3qro4JVqzxGsUxl","football","advocate","den","Truthfully, I have no idea who will win—it is just a hunch. I don't watch football. I am making my best guess. It seems that I have heard the Broncos' name mentioned in the media more than the Panthers', so I am thinking they may be favored to win.",
"R_ZwrtGTPjV6f2zkd","football","advocate","den","I believe that the Denver Broncos will win the superbowl.  I think they are far the very best team.  They are a very fantastic team.  They have proved in the past that they can win, and they are the most powerful team with the greatest players.",
"R_T1Jz4kdJ3JSTH1v","football","advocate","den","I do not follow football at all.  I based my decision on the fact that I have seen many of my friends on Facebook who do follow football supporting the Denver Broncos.  Usually a team with that number of fans has a history of winning games.  I have not seen a single person who supports the Carolina Panthers, leading me to believe they aren't a very good team.  ",
"R_3KBkQTFJcEyHkFo","football","advocate","den","The Broncos have the better defense. They will be able to hold Cam Newton from making big plays. Peyton Manning wont have a lot of yardage but he will be able to make short plays and move up the field. ",
"R_1cZHsbbMtxPCn1u","football","advocate","den","If you were to look at their stats, in terms of winnings, they are much higher than the Panthers. Also, their team has a lot more experiences, and in my opinion skills, and more experience with the Super Bowl",
"R_1NaaChbSVyH6aau","football","advocate","den","I believe that the Denver Broncos will win Super Bowl 50 because they have the better defense, and Peyton Manning is going to go out on a winning note, especially since he's rested from having spent time out with an injury and is playing excellent football!",

The Broncos have worked hard and have the will and determination to beat the Panthers in the Super Bowl.  They have good offense and defense and are likely to outsmart the Panthers.

"R_0Dob9iQeyj0hTwN","football","advocate","den","Denver is more likely to win than Carolina because this team is used to exercising at a high elevation.  The other team does not exercise at a high elevation.

"R_23VUuXjeS5tP0k0","football","advocate","den","The reasoning behind my choice for the Broncos to beat the Panthers is because Peyton Manning will dissect that Panthers defense and play to their strengths. The Panthers as a whole may be the better team, but the Broncos defense is the best in the league and Wade Phillips has ways of making an opposing offense struggle. The Broncos antagonized Tom Brady in the championship game and I assume this will occur heavily in this game against the Panthers. ",
"R_1IiMDznzgyAR1Gy","football","advocate","den","Denver is more likely than Carolina, to win the Super Bowl, because Denver has the best defense in their league.

"R_3NJVINst0YBm7lD","football","advocate","den","I believe Denver is most likely to win because of Peyton Manning. He has the most playoff experience than anyone will have on the field. Cam Newton is a young unproven quarterback. Denver's experience will beat out the Panther's talent in this high stakes game and they also have one of the best defensive teams in the league. The old saying of Defensive wins championships will prove correct in this Superbowl. The Carolina Panther's are too reliant on their run game and Denver's defensive line has what it takes to limit their yardage gains.",
